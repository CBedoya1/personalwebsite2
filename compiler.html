						<h2>Compiler Optimization Research</h2>
						<p>Finding the Right Compiler for an Application</p>
					</header>


					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>
						For state-of-art general purpose processors, chip multiprocessors (CMPs) have become the dominant form. The transition from the sequential programming to the parallel programming gave a disruptive change to the way of writing code and compiling to fully use the hardware. Performance gains for applications can no longer be achieved without modifying the underlying source code because almost all future applications are parallel. After the modification, it is the time to compile these applications and optimize them by turning on different options. In this way, insctruction count (IC) and cycles per instruction (CPI) are improved accordingly. However, there is not much research into the impact of application-level standard optimizations on various programs. This study aims at analyzing effects of different compiler optimizations on the performance of parallel applications running on CMP systems.
					</p>
					<p>
					We consider performing different degrees of optimizations with respect to workloads of the PARSEC benchmark suites. Each of them represents a multi-threaded emerging application. They have diverse application domains. This application-specific optimization study would benefit future works.
 
					</p>

					<h3>Methodology</h3>
					<p>
					We analyzed the impact on performance of four different optimization levels on the benchmark workloads in PARSEC 3.0. The diagram below explains the approach we decided to test out each workload. Each selected benchmark application was compiled four different times, each time compiled with a different optimization flag. The flags used were O0, O1, O2, and O3. Each binary produced, was run under Intel® VTune™ Amplifier XE 2013 software. The Vtune outputs the performance metrics for each benchmark.

					<h3>Experimental Results</h3>
					<p>
						We compiled the PARSEC workloads in 4 different optimization levels. Then measure CPU Time, Elapsed Time, CPI, IC using 100 runs in average. Besides the mean value of these testing, we also record the statistics including highest value, lowest value, mode value, standard deviation of these runs. Results from these tests are shown below.

					<h3>Discussion and Conclusion </h3>
					<p>
						By comparing the values in the test results and the information on the specific PARSEC applications, we found in most cases no optimization options give the worst case execution time. This proves that there are effects of optimizations on the performance on these parallel applications. Additionally, we found O1­O2 give the best cases most, which means that O1 and O2 options are good enough for application optimizations. Deepen the optimization level would harm the performance sometimes. For parallel models, such as D​edup and F​erret,​ O0 and O1 are the best options. Doing optimizations would just increase the time and thus decrease the performance. For the communication intensive models, such as F​luidanimate and F​reqmine,​ O3 gives the best performance. It means for them O3 can do some specific optimizations besides the normal ones which are able to benefit these models.
					</p>

					<p>
						After the compilation in different optimization level and running them under simulations, we evaluated the results and made a few summaries. For most applications O1-O2 are the recommended optimization levels. For pipelined models of applications O0 and O1 get better performance than higher optimization levels. O3 is the best option for communication intensive applications which have a lot of synchronization, such as locks and barriers. And in most cases O1-O3 are much better than O0, that is, doing optimization improves the performance of applications a lot. Therefore, it is safe to make a conclusion that various compiler optimizations would have effects on the performance of parallel applications running on CMP systems.
